## AI-Based-Inclusive-Credit-Scoring-System
An AI-based Inclusive Credit Scoring System that makes credit evaluation more accessible and fair. Instead of relying only on traditional credit history, it uses alternative data such as transaction patterns, payment consistency, and financial behavior to assess creditworthiness, reduce bias, and support financial inclusion.
# About the Project

Access to credit should not depend only on whether someone has taken a loan before. Many responsible individuals—such as students, small business owners, and informal workers—are often denied financial opportunities simply because they lack traditional credit history. This project was created to address that gap.

The AI-Based Inclusive Credit Scoring System aims to make credit evaluation more fair, accessible, and data-driven. Instead of relying only on past loans and credit cards, this system looks at alternative indicators like transaction patterns, payment consistency, and overall financial behavior. These insights help create a more complete picture of an individual’s financial responsibility.

# What This Project Does

This system collects user financial data, processes it through a feature engineering pipeline, and applies machine learning models to predict creditworthiness. By analyzing repayment habits and financial stability rather than just historical credit records, the model promotes financial inclusion and reduces bias.

#Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Machine Learning Algorithms

Data Visualization Tools

# Goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI can be used to build smarter, fairer credit scoring systems that give deserving individuals a better chance at accessing financial services.
